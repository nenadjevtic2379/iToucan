              <p> Dear young people,
                  <br><br>
                  Welcome to iToucan. I can tell that you’re going to be a great addition to our team. We’re all looking forward to having your energy and expertise on our projects.
                  <br><br>
                  There’s a lot to learn as you get started in these first weeks. The volume of training and new processes we’re throwing at you may feel overwhelming. So, please take a minute right now and review our company core values: open book, create happiness, adapt or die, eyes on the prize, and leave it better. You can find descriptions of these in your onboarding packet. By living these values every day, you will be successful in this company and in your career. They should guide everything that you do here.
                  <br><br>
                  I’m committed to your professional growth, and want that to be part of our ongoing conversations. We also have a company goal of providing connection, appreciation, meaning, and impact as part of your daily employee experience. If you feel like any of these aren’t happening my door is always open.
                  <br><br>
                  The rest of your onboarding plan is attached. It includes some basic office policies and identifies teammates who will get you up to speed. We’ll review it in a one-on-one later today. But in the meantime, let me (or other team members) know if there’s anything we can do to help you navigate your first few days.
                  <br><br>
                  Can’t wait to get started!
                  <br>
